          <p>Calling the Mazda <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/mazda/mx-5-miata">MX-5 Miata</a> an automotive icon is no overstatement, as its heritage stretches back more than 30 years and its cheerful driving demeanor has always been its strongest character attribute. The Miata's four-cylinder engine delivers just enough power to make it feel spunky and its chassis is delightfully balanced—perfect for zipping through curvy sections of road. Both a soft-top convertible model and a power-folding <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-sports-cars">Sport cars</a> hard-top called the RF are offered, so with either one buyers are treated to fun in the sun. The Miata's cabin is tight for two and cargo space is limited, but it wasn't made for road trips; it's designed for spirited sunny-drenched drives and track days. The fact that it remains one of the cheapest ways to get into a convertible sports car only adds to its appeal.</p>
